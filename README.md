So there are two routes that you can choose to go down. This really all depends on which language you're comfortable with working with. 

If you're using htese APIs for data science and machine learning, then follow my other portion of this guide, which gives you a crash course on another super simple API. You still need an API key, and you should keep it saved on a text file or somewhere accessible.

1. Start by getting yourself an API key.

2. Edit the file ``config.json``, with your API key, as an example:
```
{
  "key":MY-SUPER-SECRET-KEY-PLS-DONT-SHARE-ME
}
```
